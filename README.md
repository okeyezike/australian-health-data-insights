Author: Okechukwu Ezike
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn), Power BI, Jupyter Notebook
Data Source: Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)
Status: In Progress / Completed (choose one)

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes publicly available hospital admissions data in Australia from 2011 to 2023. It aims to uncover trends across age groups, genders, and diagnoses, with a special focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare system.

The insights derived are designed to inform health policy, highlight capacity challenges, and support data-driven decision-making in public health planning.

**Objectives**

* Understand long-term trends in hospital admissions.

* Identify top causes for hospitalization by demographics.

* Explore how hospital admissions changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

* Visualize regional differences and overall healthcare demand.

* Present insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**Key Questions**

* What are the most common reasons for hospital admissions?

* How do admission patterns differ by age and gender?

* Did COVID-19 significantly affect admission rates and hospital resources?

* Are there seasonal or regional patterns?

**Data Description**

The dataset includes:

* Total admissions per year

* Demographics (age, gender)

* Admission type (elective, emergency)

* Average length of stay

* Diagnoses and procedures

Data is sourced from the AIHW and may be supplemented with ABS population data for contextual analysis.

**Project Structure**

├── data/                  # Raw and cleaned datasets
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── visuals/               # Charts and dashboard screenshots
├── dashboard/             # Power BI (.pbix) file or Tableau workbook
├── README.md              # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies (optional)

**Summary of Findings**

* The top 5 causes of admission remain consistent over the years, with notable shifts during the pandemic.

* COVID-19 led to a decline in elective surgeries in 2020 and a rise in respiratory-related admissions.

* Older age groups (65+) account for a significant portion of admissions and longer stays.

* Clear regional differences in admission volume per capita were observed.

**Dashboards & Visuals**

A Power BI dashboard was created for interactive exploration of the dataset.

**Next Steps**

Incorporate Indigenous vs non-Indigenous comparisons

Add forecasting using time series modeling (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)

Extend analysis to include hospital resource use (ICU beds, ventilators)
